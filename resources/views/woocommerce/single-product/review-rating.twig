 # The template to display the reviewers star rating in reviews
 #
 # This template can be overridden by copying it to yourtheme/woocommerce/review-rating.twig.
 #
 # HOWEVER, on occasion WooCommerce will need to update template files and you
 # (the theme developer) will need to copy the new files to your theme to
 # maintain compatibility. We try to do this as little as possible, but it does
 # happen. When this occurs the version of the template file will be bumped and
 # the readme will list any important changes.
 #
 # @see     https://woocommerce.com/document/template-structure/
 # @package WooCommerce\Templates
 # @version 3.6.0
